# 🏥 Healthcare Claims Capstone SQL Project  

Hello, Everyone! 👋  

I’m excited to share my latest project: **Healthcare Claims Capstone SQL Project**! 🚀  
This project focuses on analyzing and managing healthcare claims data using SQL. It’s designed to showcase the power of structured queries in solving real-world problems in the healthcare domain.  

## 🌟 **Project Overview**  

Healthcare claims data plays a crucial role in tracking medical expenses, insurance coverage, and fraud detection. This project demonstrates how SQL can be leveraged for:  

✔️ Efficiently managing and querying large datasets.  
✔️ Gaining actionable insights into healthcare claim patterns.  
✔️ Identifying anomalies and potential fraud in claims data.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  

💻 **SQL**: The backbone for querying and analyzing healthcare claims.  
📊 **Data Visualization Tools**: For presenting insights derived from SQL queries.  
🗄️ **Database Management Systems**: Implemented on **MySQL/PostgreSQL** for managing large datasets.

## 🔑 **Key Features**  

🎯 **Data Cleaning and Transformation**  
- Handled missing, inconsistent, and duplicate data entries to prepare the dataset for analysis.  

📋 **Claims Categorization**  
- Categorized claims into outpatient, inpatient, and pharmacy claims for targeted analysis.  

📈 **Trends and Insights**  
- Generated detailed reports to uncover patterns like:  
  - High-frequency claim types.  
  - Seasonal trends in healthcare expenses.  

🔍 **Fraud Detection Analysis**  
- Developed SQL queries to flag suspicious claim activities based on predefined business rules.  

📊 **Visual Insights**  
- Designed dashboards and charts to illustrate key metrics and trends.

## 📂 **Database Design**  

The project’s database schema consists of:  

1️⃣ **Patients Table**:  
- Stores patient details such as name, age, gender, and contact information.  

2️⃣ **Providers Table**:  
- Details about healthcare providers (hospitals, clinics, etc.).  

3️⃣ **Claims Table**:  
- Contains all claim data, including dates, amounts, and categories.  

4️⃣ **Diagnosis Table**:  
- Records associated diagnoses and medical procedures.  

5️⃣ **Payments Table**:  
- Tracks payment statuses and amounts for each claim.

## 📊 **SQL Queries Implemented**  

Here are some highlights of the SQL scripts:  

✨ **Data Exploration**:  
```sql  
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_claims, claim_type  
FROM claims  
GROUP BY claim_type;  
```  
- Summarized the number of claims by type.  

✨ **High-Cost Claims**:  
```sql  
SELECT *  
FROM claims  
WHERE claim_amount > 10000  
ORDER BY claim_amount DESC;  
```  
- Identified claims with exceptionally high costs.  

✨ **Fraud Detection**:  
```sql  
SELECT patient_id, COUNT(*) AS suspicious_claims  
FROM claims  
WHERE claim_amount > (SELECT AVG(claim_amount) * 2 FROM claims)  
GROUP BY patient_id  
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;  
```  
- Detected patients with multiple high-value claims.

## 🔍 **Use Cases and Insights**  

📌 **For Insurers**:  
- Identified high-cost claims and patterns in fraudulent activities.  

📌 **For Healthcare Providers**:  
- Analyzed trends in service usage for resource allocation.  

📌 **For Policymakers**:  
- Gained insights into healthcare trends for better decision-making.
